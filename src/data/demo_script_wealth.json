This means that the money in it grows tax-deferred until it is withdrawn to pay for qualifying education expenses. There are different investment options offered depending on your risk tolerance and child’s age. There are two main types: education savings plans and prepaid tuition plans."

This plan allows you to invest money that will grow and eventually give you flexibility to pay for education expenses for K-12 and college. On the other hand, a prepaid tuition plan allows you to pay for future college tuition locked in at today’s price. The credits you purchase then have to be used for qualified expenses for a set list of colleges. To help you pick one, can you tell me about your desires and goals for Madeline’s education?"

      "type": "Agent",
