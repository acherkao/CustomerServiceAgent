I’m getting fed up with having to move my money between banks. All I want is to somehow consolidate my funds in one place.

Also, I hear that you have to drive a lot for work and you love shopping for food, and this card earns you 3% cash back on groceries, 2% on gas, and 1% on everything else. Over time your savings will add up! How does this sound to you?"
